# Contributing

That you for your interest in contributing to this project!

Here's a few things to keep in mind:

- If you're unsure if a feature would be a good addition, please create an issue to discuss it first.
- Raising a issue before submitting a PR is always a good idea.
- Please try to keep your PRs small and focused to a particular change.
- Ideally, all new features would be accompanied by a set of tests.
- All API changes should also be fully documented.
- Please also make sure that code changes meet the project's coding standards and style.
- Be mindful of others and ensure that you have read our Code of Conduct.

## Reporting Issues

Before you open a new issue, first check if there is already an issue open that covers your problem. If there is, add your reaction. If you think it can be improved, please add a comment, but just comment something repetitive like "I have the same issue" or "+1", these are not helpful and will be removed.

Please use the appropriate issue template when creating a new issue.
